BACKGROUND I-GENE	: O	Ischemic I-GENE	heart I-GENE	disease I-GENE	is I-GENE	the O	primary I-GENE	cause I-GENE	of O	morbidity I-GENE	and O	mortality I-GENE	among I-GENE	diabetics I-GENE	, O	especially I-GENE	those I-GENE	who I-GENE	became I-GENE	ill I-GENE	at I-GENE	a O	young I-GENE	age I-GENE	. O	
More I-GENE	importantly I-GENE	, O	this I-GENE	fusion I-GENE	converted I-GENE	a O	less I-GENE	effective I-GENE	vaccine I-GENE	into I-GENE	one I-GENE	with I-GENE	significant I-GENE	potency I-GENE	against I-GENE	established I-GENE	E7 O	- I-GENE	expressing I-GENE	metastatic I-GENE	tumors I-GENE	. O	
Reverse I-GENE	transcription I-GENE	- I-GENE	PCR I-GENE	analysis I-GENE	of O	mRNA I-GENE	from O	patients I-GENE	shows I-GENE	that I-GENE	each I-GENE	of O	these I-GENE	five I-GENE	mutations O	results I-GENE	in O	aberrant I-GENE	splicing I-GENE	. O	
Using I-GENE	the O	postural I-GENE	and O	force I-GENE	data I-GENE	as I-GENE	input I-GENE	to O	a O	3 I-GENE	- I-GENE	D I-GENE	biomechanical I-GENE	model I-GENE	, O	the O	lumbosacral I-GENE	spinal I-GENE	compression I-GENE	was I-GENE	calculated I-GENE	. O	
Sequence I-GENE	analysis I-GENE	revealed I-GENE	significant I-GENE	differences I-GENE	between I-GENE	the O	5 I-GENE	' O	region O	of O	the O	beta I-GENE	subunit I-GENE	gene I-GENE	and O	the O	corresponding I-GENE	regions O	of O	the O	homologous O	GlyR I-GENE	alpha I-GENE	subunit I-GENE	genes I-GENE	; O	it I-GENE	also I-GENE	identified I-GENE	a O	novel I-GENE	exon I-GENE	( O	exon I-GENE	0 I-GENE	) O	that I-GENE	encodes I-GENE	most I-GENE	of O	the O	5 I-GENE	'- O	untranslated I-GENE	portion I-GENE	of O	the O	GlyR I-GENE	beta I-GENE	mRNA I-GENE	.

Therefore I-GENE	, O	we I-GENE	suggested I-GENE	that I-GENE	both I-GENE	proteins I-GENE	might I-GENE	belong I-GENE	to O	the O	PLTP I-GENE	family I-GENE	. O
