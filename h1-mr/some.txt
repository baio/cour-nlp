We've now corrected the videos on the Viterbi lectures to fix this bug (thanks again for catching it), and to match the note at http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~mcollins/notes-spring2013.html

The new definitions are close to the old ones, but are now correct. We have

π(0,∗,∗)=1
as the base case, and the recursive case is now:

For any k∈1…n, for any u∈Sk−1 and v∈Sk:

π(k,u,v)=maxw∈Sk−2(π(k−1,w,u)×q(v|w,u)×e(xk|v))
where Sk is defined to be the set of possible tags at position k: more precisely

S−1=S0= {*}

and

Sk=S for k=1…n
where S is the set of possible tags.
